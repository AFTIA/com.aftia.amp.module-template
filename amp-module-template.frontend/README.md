# AFTIA Core UI

### Fully Coded Components

Vue Notus is built with over frontend 120 components, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colors, that you can easily modify using Tailwind CSS classes (NOTE: each time you add a new class, a class that does not exist in `src/assets/styles/tailwind.css`, you will need to compile again tailwind).

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented.
This Free Tailwind CSS Template is coming with prebuilt examples, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

Every element has multiple states for colors, styles, hover, focus, that you can easily access and use.
